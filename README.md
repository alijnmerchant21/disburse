# Disburse

**Disburse** is a simple, user-friendly multi-wallet balance dashboard that lets users connect and consolidate their crypto wallets across multiple chains into a single, easy-to-understand view.

## About

Disburse addresses the challenge of managing digital assets across multiple wallets and chains. Current web3 tools either show balances per wallet or require complex navigation between interfaces. There's no simple unified view aimed at non-crypto users, making it hard to understand total holdings.

Disburse solves this by aggregating balances from multiple connected wallets into a single, simple dashboard.
